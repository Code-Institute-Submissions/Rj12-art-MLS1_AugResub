# Bar Aldo Coffe Shop

## Introduction

Welcome to my first project. This project is a website based on a local coffee shop called Bar Aldo found in 3km away from the center of one of the Italian most famouse villages around the venetian region on the North Eastern part of Italy. As many different countries in different continent consider the bar being a place to find only liquor yet in Italy it's a place you can find both coffee,snacks,liquor and ice-cream. 
A bar is considered a place to hang out with friends and family having coffee or a snack together, most people have breakfast at the bar on weekends in Italy.
This website shows you how much you can find in a bar in Italy .

A live website can be found [here](https://rj12-art.github.io/Bar-Aldo/).

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

 - Responsive on all devices sizes
 - Navigation bar is placed beneath the home page image and is clear and easy to use.
 - Footer at the bottom of the page that links to the social media websites.
 - All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.

I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create my wireframes as this gives the template of the UI. This also shows where all elements will be placed within the screen.

There are 2 versions of each wireframe as one shows the design on a web browser and the other shows a mobile browser format.

# 4. Testing
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

## Automated testing
### Google Developer Tools

For every element that I added to my HTML, I would add the basic CSS to my stylesheet. I would then use the inspect element to try different styles. Once I've got it to my liking I would copy the CSS from google into my stylesheet. This allows me to keep track of the code I am using.

### Responsive Tools

I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) to make sure that all my pages are responsive to all devices.

### W3C Validator Tools

I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check for any errors within my HTML pages.

I had an error on the index.html page with the iframe attribute of "frameborder". The HTML checker notified me that this attribute is obsolete and to use CSS instead.

I also had an error on the contact_us.html page with a duplicate ID of "form_inline". I rectified this by changing the ID's to a class instead and updated the CSS for this.

I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any error within my CSS stylesheet.

## Manual Testing

I have tested my site on Safari and google chrome on multiple devices.
I also used [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) as a playground to test all of my code before staging and committing any changes.

These include:
  - iPhone X
  - iPhone XS Max
  - iPad Pro
  - ipad
  - laptop

Please find below my testing process for all pages via mobile and web:

    - Home - When selecting "home", the browser redirects me to the home page. The text in the navigation bar also stays highlighted in red. It worked as expected.

    - Responsiveness
      - I checked that all pages and elements were responsive. Checking each page on mobile and website and adjusting screen size to find break points. It worked as expected.

# 5. Development Cycle
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

There were many elements I changed, re-positioned and added from my original wireframes as they were more visually appealing.

### All pages:
 - Replaced the Sir Alex Photo on the top right with just a text. This is visually more appealing because the text can fit inside the navigation bar.

### Landing page:
  - The original wireframe lacked attention from users. I added an embedded YouTube video to make the user more variety with different media elements. This video is also a short introduction to what the website is about.

### Career page:
  - I added a statistics panel to show the numbers Sir Alex achieved during his career.
  - The original design shows the timeline is continuously on the left side of the page. I decided to change this to make the timeline appear on the centre of the page with the content displaying on the left then the right side of the page. This keeps the user engaged as the content isn't just a block of text.

### Testimonials page:
  - The original wireframe shows this page as an awards page with the same timeline design as the career page however, I changed this to a testimonials page. This is to give the user a better experience with a different format from the career page. As I was planning to use the same design the user would have been less engaged as they felt like they were reading the same content in the same format.
  - I added in a cards view, this gives the user smaller amounts of content so it's easy to process. The image on each card also gives the context of who the quote was from.

### Gallery page:
  - The gallery page has remained the same. I added a hover animation over each photo to give the context of what the image is about.

### Contact page:
 - After coding the contact page to the original design. I thought that it looked dull, so I added other elements to make this page visually appealing to the users.
 - Added google maps location
 - Added icons for location, telephone number and contact email.

# 6. Deployment
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

I used GitHub pages to deploy my final project. To do this I had to:

1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository on your chosen source code editor (Atom in my case) using the clone link.
4. Add files to Git (staging area) and use the atom commit to master button.
5. Use git within atom to push the code.
7. Go to GitHub and load your repository.
8. Select settings.
9. Select pages on the left menu bar.
10. Click on the master branch.
11. This will now generate a link with your website live.

# 8. Known Bugs
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  - On some mobile devices the navigation bar appears behind the content. This was rectified by adding a z-index to the CSS for the navigation bar.
  - My first implementation of the navigation bar was not responsive on mobile devices, meaning that the design was floating off the screen. This was rectified by implementing a new navbar that included a hamburger style button when the screen size gets smaller.
  - The form styling on some mobile devices do not match the web styles. This was rectified by adding WebKit appearance, appearance in the CSS and set the value to none.
  - The video on the home page was not responsive. This was fixed by adding a height value in the CSS in smaller media queries.
  - The managerial career stats section was also not responsive. This was fixed by adding a smaller font-size value to the media query of max-width 635px. This allowed the whole section to be visible on mobile devices.
