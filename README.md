# Bar Aldo Coffe Shop

## Introduction

Welcome to my first project. This project is a website based on a local coffee shop called Bar Aldo found in 3km away from the center of one of the Italian most famouse villages around the venetian region on the North Eastern part of Italy. As many different countries in different continent consider the bar being a place to find only liquor yet in Italy it's a place you can find both coffee,snacks,liquor and ice-cream. 
A bar is considered a place to hang out with friends and family having coffee or a snack together, most people have breakfast at the bar on weekends in Italy.
This website shows you how much you can find in a bar in Italy .

A live website can be found [here](https://rj12-art.github.io/MLS1/).

## i Structure
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

It is really important to include responsive design in this project as many users are using different devices (mobile, tablet, laptop/PC). This gives the user the best experience on their device.

 - Responsive on all devices sizes
 - Navigation bar is placed beneath the home page image and is clear and easy to use.
 - Footer at the bottom of the page that links to the social media websites.
 - All elements will be consistent including font size, font family, colour scheme.
 
  ###  Colour scheme
Since the website is displaying edible products, I had to be critical in color mixture [here](https://www.color-hex.com/color-wheel/).

### Typography
I decided to use Roboto as my font of choice with sans serf as my backup font for browsers that might not support Roboto.

## Favicon
I used fontawesome to import icons I could use on the sections [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Automated testing
### Google Developer Tools

For every element that I added to my HTML, I would add the basic CSS to my stylesheet. I would then use the inspect element to try different styles. Once I've got it to my liking I would copy the CSS from google into my stylesheet. This allows me to keep track of the code I am using.

### Responsive Tools

I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) to make sure that all my pages are responsive to all devices.

### W3C Validator Tools

I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check for any errors within my HTML pages.
The pages showed no errors after every code validation.
![W3C Markup Validation results]()

I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any error within my CSS stylesheet.

## Manual Testing

I have tested my site on firefox and google chrome on multiple devices.
I also used [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse.net/) as a playground to test all of my code before staging and committing any changes.

These include:
  - iPhone X
  - iPhone XS Max
  - iPad Pro
  - ipad
  - laptop 

    - Text:
      - I checked that all text is in the correct and consistent size and font. I also checked that there were no typos.

    - Media:
      - I checked that all images on this sections load. Making sure that all images have alt text if media does not load. It worked as expected.

    - Responsiveness
      - I checked that all sections and elements were responsive. Checking each section on mobile and website and adjusting screen size to find break points. It worked as expected.

  - Footer:
    - Instagram -  When selecting the Instagram icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Instagram website. It worked as expected.
    - Facebook - When selecting the Facebook icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the Facebook website. It worked as expected.
    - YouTube - When selecting the YouTube icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the YouTube website. It worked as expected.
    - linked - when selecting the linked icon, a new tab opens and redirects to the linked website.
    - Home - when selecting the home icon, it redirects a user to the top of the home page of the website.

# 6. Deployment
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

I used GitHub pages to deploy my final project. To do this I had to do the following steps:
1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository on your chosen source code editor (Atom in my case) using the clone link.
4. Add files to Git (staging area) and use the atom commit to master button.
5. Use git within atom to push the code.
7. Go to GitHub and load your repository.
8. Select settings.
9. Select pages on the left menu bar.
10. Click on the master branch.
11. This will now generate a link with your website live.

* Background-Image
 - The background image at the top of the website wasn't loading so it was a heck of a strugle and I ahd to check on the url how the file path is written and it turned out the file path was misswritten so I corrected and it loadded as expected.

* CSS
 -CSS wasn't responding on some point so I had to delete the folders containing it and open new ones and update the link path on the index file.
